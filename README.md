# DeviantArtScrapperPy

This is a python program which scrapes using `beautifulsoup4`,`selenim` and `requests` the deviantart website for popular steam artworks.
Then using the steam links, it fetches the steam price of the game and saves it to a file.
The program also generates a html file using `streamlit` with the data.

### Optional:

- You can add new links to the `links.txt` file to scrape more artworks.
- You can change the number of links to check by changing the `links_to_scrape` variable in the `main.py` file. For example, if you want to scrape 10 links from the `links.txt`, change the `links_to_scrape` variable to 10.(Note: The links are scraped in the order they are in the `links.txt` file. Also make sure that the links are valid and are within the length of the file.)
- You can adjust the number of pages to visit by changing the `pages_to_check` variable in the `main.py` file. For example, if you want to visit 5 pages per link, change the `pages_to_check` variable to 5.
